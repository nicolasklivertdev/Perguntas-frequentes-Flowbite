                        <h2>How does support work?</h2>
                        <p>We are aware of the importance of well qualified support, that is why we decided that support will only be provided by the authors that actually worked on this project.</p>
                        <p>You can <a href="#">contact us</a> on this page via email or discuss via the chatroom on the bottom right side of this page.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to <a href="#">join our Discord channel</a> and let one of the project maintainers know that you have purchased Flowbite Pro. You will then have access to a private support channel.</p>

                        <h2>I want to build more than one project with Flowbite Pro. Is that allowed?</h2>
                        <p>You can use Flowbite for an unlimited amount of projects, whether it is a personal website, a SaaS app, or a website for a client. As long as you don't build a product that will directly compete with Flowbite either as a UI kit, theme, or template, it is fine.</p>

                        <p>The free updates that will be provided is based on the <a href="#">roadmap</a> that we have laid out for this project. It is also possible that we will provide extra updates outside of the roadmap as well.</p>

                        <h2>What does the free version include?</h2>
                        <p>The <a href="#">free version</a> of Flowbite includes a minimal style guidelines, component variants, and a dashboard page with the mobile version alongside it.</p>
                        <p>You can use this version for any purposes, because it is open-source under the MIT license.</p>

                        <h2>Is there React/Vue/Svelte version supported?</h2>
                        <p>Currently the most supported framework is React and Next.js next to the Figma and HTML + JavaScript version of Flowbite Pro. We already offer a dashboard in React and Next.js and over 300 blocks and components in React.</p>
                        <p>Eventually all of the pro components, sections, and pages will be integrated into React, Vue, and Svelte. This will take some time and you should expect the React version to be released the soonest.</p>
                        <p>These launches also depend on how fast we can build the libraries such as Flowbite React, Flowbite Vue, Flowbite Svelte, and Flowbite Angular.</p>

                        <h2>What is the difference between Tailwind UI and Flowbite Pro?</h2>
                        <p>The main difference is that you get everything you see in the demo already put together, in comparison with Tailwind UI where you have to manually put together the section based code blocks.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, Flowbite also offers a set of advanced libraries such as charts, calendar, kanban board which Tailwind UI does not currently support.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, as Tailwind UI announced that it will no longer support Figma for future release, with Flowbite you can rest assured that we will keep updating the Figma files as we develop new pages and sections.</p>
